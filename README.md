üì± **Install as App**: Look for the "Install" button in your browser or "Add to Home Screen" option to install FinCon as a native app on your device!

## ü§ñ Smart Explanations

FinCon provides personalized, contextual explanations that adapt to your specific financial situation. The app analyzes your inputs and provides tailored advice based on:

- **Your age and retirement timeline** - Different strategies for different life stages
- **Loan amount and terms** - Contextual advice based on your borrowing level  
- **Malaysian financial context** - Local investment options, banking practices, and regulations
- **Risk tolerance by timeframe** - Age-appropriate investment allocation suggestions

### For Developers: Enhanced AI Explanations
Developers can optionally enable OpenAI-powered dynamic explanations:

1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `config.js` file
3. The `config.js` file is automatically ignored by git for security

**Note**: The app provides excellent personalized explanations without any API keys - this enhancement is purely optional for developers who want to experiment with AI-generated content.

## üöÄ Secure Deployment with Dynamic Explanations

To deploy FinCon with secure dynamic explanations (without exposing API keys):

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Fork/Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinCon.git
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
   - Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it as a static site with serverless functions

3. **Configure Environment Variable**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key value
   - This keeps your API key secure on the server side

4. **Deploy**
   - Vercel automatically deploys on every git push
   - Your app will have dynamic AI explanations at your custom Vercel URL

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Deploy Site**
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
   - Set build command to `npm run build` (if using build process)

2. **Add Netlify Function**
   - Move `api/explain.js` to `netlify/functions/explain.js`
   - Update frontend API calls to `/netlify/functions/explain`

3. **Environment Variables**
   - In Netlify dashboard, add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

### How It Works

- **Frontend**: Makes API calls to `/api/explain` endpoint
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless function securely calls OpenAI API
- **Fallback**: If backend unavailable, falls back to client-side API (if configured) or static explanations
- **Security**: API key stored as environment variable, never exposed in code
